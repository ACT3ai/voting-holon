# Future  

This is the Election Integrity "Voting Holon" 
## Plans:
1. Paper Ballet Voting Secured
1. Voting Machines: For states that won't move to only Paper ballets.  It prints out a way for the citizen to verify their vote on the blockchain later. Ways to make sure only qualified US citizens vote (and only once).


# Secure Voting System Proposal — VotingHolon Project

## Introduction

The work of both contributors in this field is invaluable. As a serial startup CTO and CEO founder, I am committed to building a voting system that permanently locks out election fraud. The objective is to design a verifiable, transparent, and tamper-resistant election infrastructure leveraging blockchain and cryptography.  

All progress and concepts are being gradually published at [https://votingholon.com](https://votingholon.com).  
Currently, this website contains about **3%** of the overall plan. The ideas below are a deeper look into what’s coming next.

## Design Goals and Approach

Some U.S. states will continue to allow **mail-in ballots**, while others may adopt **in-person only voting**.  
This system is designed to **handle both models simultaneously** with high integrity and full auditability.

### a) Open Source Software and Blockchain Architecture

- The entire software platform will be **open source**, ensuring public auditability and security transparency.  
- **Private voter data (PII)** is stored securely in a **private government database**.  
- The **non-PII portions** — such as anonymized ballot and voter roll activity — are **stored on the blockchain** for verifiable public transparency.

## Voting Rolls and Accountability

### b) State Election Office Integration

- The **voter rolls** used by each **state election office** are directly integrated into the system.  
- Personally identifiable information (PII) remains in a **private, permissioned database**.  
- **Non-PII data** — such as voter status, eligibility verification logs, and record timestamps — are written immutably to the **blockchain**.

### c) Government Employee Logging and Traceability

- The system **logs which government employee** adds or modifies an entry in the voter rolls.  
- It is a **criminal act** to register non-eligible voters.  
- The blockchain ledger creates a **provable, immutable record** of who performed each voter entry action.  
- Since blockchain history **cannot be deleted**, any attempt at fraud becomes **traceable to the individual** responsible.

## Voting Process: In-Person Ballots

### d) Ballot Privacy and Blockchain Verification

- For in-person voting, **each ballot** would come with a **paper identifier** that prints out when the ballot is opened.  
- This paper allows the voter to **privately identify** their specific ballot on the blockchain without revealing who they voted for.  
- A **secure web application UI** provides an intuitive interface for voters to verify their ballot’s presence on the blockchain.

### e) Cryptographic Privacy Layer

- **Public-private key cryptography** secures privacy.  
- The design ensures that **no government entity** can ever determine **which candidate** a voter selected.  
- Voter identity and vote choice remain **mathematically unlinkable**.

### f) Ballot Scanning and Post-Vote Verification

- When voters **exit the booth**, their ballot is **scanned immediately**.  
- The voter receives a **“Paper QR Code Private Key”** to take home.  
- Later, they can **verify online** that their vote was correctly recorded for the intended candidates by scanning this private QR key.  
- This process allows **independent verification** without revealing any voter’s identity.

### g) Real-Time Polling Location Metrics

- Each voting location uploads data to the blockchain showing:  
  - **Number of voters per hour**  
  - **Total ballots cast**  
  - **System activity logs and tallies**  
- This provides **real-time transparency** into voting activity while preserving ballot secrecy.

### h) Cryptographic Protection Against Vote Linking

- Even though each ballot entry is public on the blockchain, **it is cryptographically impossible to determine voter preference**.  
- The system uses a combination of:
  - **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)** — allowing mathematical operations on encrypted votes without decryption.
  - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** — ensuring verification of validity without revealing vote contents.  
- Together, these create **verifiable transparency with absolute privacy**.

---

## Voting Process: Mail-In Ballots

### i) Secure Ballot Minting and Tracking

- For states that allow **mail-in ballots**, the system provides a cryptographically verifiable “minting” process.  
- Ballots are **produced in secure batches**, e.g., boxes of **300 ballots per batch**.  
- Each ballot within the batch is assigned a **unique public key**, represented as a **QR code**.  
- When ballots are **sent out**, each QR-coded ballot’s **public key** is scanned and linked to the specific voter record (in the private database) it was mailed to.  
- This linkage — voter ID (privately held) ↔ ballot public key (publicly tracked) — is **recorded on the blockchain**.  
- This ensures every mailed ballot can be accounted for from printing to delivery to return — **eliminating the possibility of ghost or duplicate ballots**.

## Summary of System Guarantees

| **Feature** | **Function** | **Blockchain Role** | **Privacy Guarantee** |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Voter Roll Logs** | Tracks who adds voters | Immutable log | Government staff accountability |
| **In-Person Ballots** | On-site scanning + QR receipt | Real-time blockchain entry | Anonymous tracking via cryptographic keys |
| **Mail-In Ballots** | Boxed “minted” ballots with unique keys | Verifiable issue and tracking | Only linkage of issuance, not vote choice |
| **Vote Privacy** | Cryptography layer (HE + ZKP) | Validates correctness | No vote-to-voter linkage possible |
| **Auditability** | Open-source + blockchain data | Public validation | Transparent yet privacy-preserving |

---

## Conclusion

This framework establishes a next-generation **election integrity platform** that:
- Uses **blockchain immutability** to make voter roll changes and ballot counts fully auditable,  
- Leverages **cryptography** to separate identity from vote,  
- Supports both **in-person and mail-in voting**, and  
- Operates under **open-source transparency**.

Together, these elements create a **verifiable, fraud-resistant voting system** that citizens, officials, and independent auditors alike can trust.  

Future publications on [VotingHolon.com](https://votingholon.com) will expand on this foundation — including user interface design, API specifications, and deeper cryptographic protocol design.
